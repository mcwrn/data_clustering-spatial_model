# data_clustering-spatial_model
Me and Franciszek Soldek performed a spatial and clustering analysis of respiratory disease risk across Intermediate Zones in Glasgow for 2 years of data. It was a final assignment for the university course "A spatial data science approach to model-based clustering and semi-supervised variable selection". See: .pdf document https://github.com/mcwrn/data_clustering-spatial_model/blob/main/data_combined/project_finalversion.pdf for a description of the presented work and https://github.com/mcwrn/data_clustering-spatial_model/blob/main/data_combined/project1.rmd for the underlying code in RMarkdown.
